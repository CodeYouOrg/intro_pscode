Explanation:
Initialization: Displays a welcome message and instructions to the player.
Random Number Generation: Generates a random number between 1 and 10 using a suitable function (`GENERATE_RANDOM_NUMBER`).
Game Loop:
Iterates 3 times, allowing the player 3 attempts.
Prompts the player to enter their guess.
Input Validation (Optional): Checks if the input is a valid number within the specified range. If not, displays an error message and prompts again without counting as an attempt.
Compare the player's guess with the secret number using conditional statements (`IF-ELSE`).
Provides feedback to the player (too high, too low, or correct).
If the player guesses correctly, displays a winning message and exits the loop.
Game Over: If the player doesn't guess within 3 attempts, displays a game over message and reveals the secret number.
