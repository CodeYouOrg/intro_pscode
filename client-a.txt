Explanation of the Pseudocode:
Start: Begin the game.
Generate a Random Number: The computer picks a number between 1 and 10.
Set Up Variables:
attempts keeps track of how many guesses the player has left.
guessedCorrectly is a flag to indicate if the player has guessed the number.
Game Rules: Print instructions for the player.
