# Pseudocode Task Instructions

**This assignment has *multiple* steps, please *read* the steps *completely* and *thoroughly*. You may need to review, research, problem solve, and ask questions.**

## **Overview:**
You are tasked with writing **pseudocode** for **3** new programs for different clients. The pseudocode will then be added to a presentation for each client. Review each of the the three tasks and prioritize them for yourself. Then complete each task and sync the files to Github for the team.

## **Objective:**
Write **three (3)** psuedocode programs, and get them synced to GitHub so the team can add them to the presentations.

- [ ] Review the following **3** client tasks. (Task A, Task B, Task C)
- [ ] Fork this repository (**https://github.com/CodeYouOrg/intro_pscode**) to your own GitHub account.
- [ ] Clone the repository down to your local projects folder.
- [ ] Complete each of the **3** tasks by updating the correct file that matches the task and client. (*example: **Task A** should be written in the the file **client-a.txt***)
- [ ] Update and sync your local repository to GitHub.
- [ ] Copy the link to your repository. (*example: **https://github.com/your-github-username/intro_pscode***)
- [ ] Turn in the link to your repository of the assignment in [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/).
- [ ] Practice more...

## Client Tasks

### Task A: Guess the Number Game

**Task:** Write pseudocode for a number guessing game. The computer chooses a random number between 1 and 10, and the player has 3 chances to guess.

**Hints:** Input/output, conditional logic

---

### Task B: Find the Spot

**Task:** Develop a mapping (walking) application to find a specific set location in a large warehouse store for a customer. The customer can move north, south, east, or west.

**Hints:** Loops, Variables

---

### Task C: Product Package Counter

**Task:** You need to develop a program that counts the number of items that a hardware device scans to sort for boxing packages into cases. Each package scanned is two (2) products. Each case can only fit 50 product packages. Write a program that prints numbers from 2 to 50, counting by twos.

**Hint:** Loops

## Notes and Operators Guide

### Notes

- Please refer to any previous materials for help.
- These are exercises to get used to the process of writing pseudocode and real syntax. When you build a house you start with a blueprint of the house. Pseudocode is the blueprint for your program.
- Elements of syntax may be used in your pseudocode, but it should not be all code.
- Write the psuedocode for the client that doesnt know much about programing beyond basic concepts.

#### What Pseudocode is:

- **A Simplified, Human-Readable Outline** - Pseudocode is a way to describe the steps or logic of a program in plain language, without using the specific syntax of any programming language. It's designed to be easy for people to understand, even if they don't know the code itself.
- **A Focus on Logic and Structure** - It focuses on the flow of a program or algorithm, highlighting key programming concepts like loops, conditionals, functions, etc. It doesn’t worry about technical details like syntax or data types.
- **A Planning Tool** - Pseudocode is often used in the early stages of development to plan how the program will work. It's great for outlining a solution before diving into writing actual code.
- **Flexible and Informal** - There's no strict "right" way to write pseudocode. You can format it however it makes sense to you and the people you're working with. The goal is clarity, not precision.

#### What Pseudocode is NOT:

- **Not Actual Code** - Pseudocode cannot be executed by a computer. It’s not written in any programming language, and there are no syntax rules that need to be followed. Its purpose is purely for humans to read and understand the logic.
- **Not Syntax-Specific** - Unlike real code, pseudocode doesn’t adhere to the rules of any particular programming language. You don’t need to worry about semicolons, brackets, or the exact way functions are called.
- **Not Concerned with Low-Level Details** - Pseudocode does not deal with implementation details like memory management, variable declarations, or optimizing the performance of the code. It focuses on the logic, not the technicalities.
- **Not Final or Perfect** - It's meant to evolve. Pseudocode is often used as a draft to organize thoughts, so it’s perfectly fine to revise and refine it as you progress towards writing real code.

### Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| + | Addition (a+b) | This operation adds both the operands on either side of the + operator. |
| - | Subtraction (a-b) | This operation subtracts the right-hand operand from the left. |
| * | Multiplication (a*b) | This operation multiplies both the operands. |
| / | Division (a/b) | This operation divides the left-hand operand by the operand on the right. |
| % | Modulus (a%b) | This operation returns the remainder after dividing the left-hand operand by the right operand. |

### Logical Operators

| Operator | Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| && | AND (a&&b) | This operator returns TRUE only if both the operands are TRUE or if both the conditions are satisfied. It not, it returns FALSE. |
| || | OR (a||b) | This operator returns TRUE if either operand is TRUE. It also returns TRUE if both the operands are TRUE. If neither operand is true, it returns FALSE. |
| ! | NOT (!a) | This unary operator returns TRUE if the operand is FALSE and vice versa. It is used to reverse the logical state of its (single) operand. |

### Relational Operators

| Operator | Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| === | Exact Equals (a===a) | This operator checks if both sides are equal but also cares if types are same and equal. |
| == | Equal (a==b) | This operator checks if the values of both operands are equal. If yes, the condition becomes TRUE. |
| != | Not equal (a!=b) | This operator checks if the values of both operands are equal. If not, the condition becomes TRUE. |
| > | Greater than (a>b) | This operator checks if the left operand value is greater than the right. If yes, the condition becomes TRUE. |
| < | Less than (a<b) | This operator checks if the left operand is less than the value of right. If yes, the condition becomes TRUE. |
| >= | Greater than or equal (a>=b) | This operator checks if the left operand value is greater than or equal to the value of the right. If either condition is satisfied, the operator returns a TRUE value. |
| <= | Less than or equal (a<=b) | This operator checks if the left operand value is less than or equal to the value of the right. If either condition is satisfied, the operator returns a TRUE value. |
