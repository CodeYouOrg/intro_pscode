## Operators Guide

### Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| + | Addition (a+b) | This operation adds both the operands on either side of the + operator. |
| - | Subtraction (a-b) | This operation subtracts the right-hand operand from the left. |
| * | Multiplication (a*b) | This operation multiplies both the operands. |
| / | Division (a/b) | This operation divides the left-hand operand by the operand on the right. |
| % | Modulus (a%b) | This operation returns the remainder after dividing the left-hand operand by the right operand. |

### Logical Operators

| Operator | Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| && | AND (a&&b) | This operator returns TRUE only if both the operands are TRUE or if both the conditions are satisfied. It not, it returns FALSE. |
| || | OR (a||b) | This operator returns TRUE if either operand is TRUE. It also returns TRUE if both the operands are TRUE. If neither operand is true, it returns FALSE. |
| ! | NOT (!a) | This unary operator returns TRUE if the operand is FALSE and vice versa. It is used to reverse the logical state of its (single) operand. |


### Relational Operators

| Operator | Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| === | Exact Equals (a===a) | This operator checks if both sides are equal but also cares if types are same and equal. |
| == | Equal (a==b) | This operator checks if the values of both operands are equal. If yes, the condition becomes TRUE. |
| != | Not equal (a!=b) | This operator checks if the values of both operands are equal. If not, the condition becomes TRUE. |
| > | Greater than (a>b) | This operator checks if the left operand value is greater than the right. If yes, the condition becomes TRUE. |
| < | Less than (a<b) | This operator checks if the left operand is less than the value of right. If yes, the condition becomes TRUE. |
| >= | Greater than or equal (a>=b) | This operator checks if the left operand value is greater than or equal to the value of the right. If either condition is satisfied, the operator returns a TRUE value. |
| <= | Less than or equal (a<=b) | This operator checks if the left operand value is less than or equal to the value of the right. If either condition is satisfied, the operator returns a TRUE value. |
