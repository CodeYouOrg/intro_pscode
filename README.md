# Pseudocode Tasks

## Instructions

**This assignment has *multiple* steps, please *read* the steps *completely* and *thoroughly*. You may need to review, research, problem solve, and ask questions.**

**Overview:**
You are tasked with writing **pseudocode** for **3** new programs for **3** different clients. Review each of the the three tasks and prioritize them for yourself. You are then tasked with writing the pseudocode for the three client presentations.

**Objective:**
Write **Three (3)** Psuedocode Programs, and get them synced to GitHub so the team can add them to the presentations.

- [ ] Review the following **3** tasks. (Task A, Task B, Task C)
- [ ] Fork this repository (**https://github.com/CodeYouOrg/intro_pscode**) to your GitHub account.
- [ ] Clone the repository down to your local projects folder.
- [ ] Complete each of the **3** tasks by updating the correct file that matches the task and client. (*example: **Task A** should be written in the the file **client-a.txt***)
- [ ] Update and sync your local repository to GitHub.
- [ ] Copy the link to your repository. (*example: **https://github.com/your-github-username/intro_pscode***)
- [ ] Turn in the link to your repository of the assignment in [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/).





## Client Tasks

### Task A: Count to 100 by Twos

**Task:** Write pseudocode to print numbers from 2 to 100, counting by twos.

**Hint:** Loops

---

### Task B: Treasure Hunt

**Task:** Design pseudocode to find hidden treasure. The player can move north, south, east, or west.

**Hints:** Loops, Variables

---

### Task C: Guess the Number Game

**Task:** Write pseudocode for a number guessing game. The computer chooses a random number between 1 and 10, and the player has 3 chances to guess.

**Hints:** Input/output, conditional logic

## Operators Guide

### Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| + | Addition (a+b) | This operation adds both the operands on either side of the + operator. |
| - | Subtraction (a-b) | This operation subtracts the right-hand operand from the left. |
| * | Multiplication (a*b) | This operation multiplies both the operands. |
| / | Division (a/b) | This operation divides the left-hand operand by the operand on the right. |
| % | Modulus (a%b) | This operation returns the remainder after dividing the left-hand operand by the right operand. |

### Logical Operators

| Operator | Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| && | AND (a&&b) | This operator returns TRUE only if both the operands are TRUE or if both the conditions are satisfied. It not, it returns FALSE. |
| || | OR (a||b) | This operator returns TRUE if either operand is TRUE. It also returns TRUE if both the operands are TRUE. If neither operand is true, it returns FALSE. |
| ! | NOT (!a) | This unary operator returns TRUE if the operand is FALSE and vice versa. It is used to reverse the logical state of its (single) operand. |


### Relational Operators

| Operator | Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| === | Exact Equals (a===a) | This operator checks if both sides are equal but also cares if types are same and equal. |
| == | Equal (a==b) | This operator checks if the values of both operands are equal. If yes, the condition becomes TRUE. |
| != | Not equal (a!=b) | This operator checks if the values of both operands are equal. If not, the condition becomes TRUE. |
| > | Greater than (a>b) | This operator checks if the left operand value is greater than the right. If yes, the condition becomes TRUE. |
| < | Less than (a<b) | This operator checks if the left operand is less than the value of right. If yes, the condition becomes TRUE. |
| >= | Greater than or equal (a>=b) | This operator checks if the left operand value is greater than or equal to the value of the right. If either condition is satisfied, the operator returns a TRUE value. |
| <= | Less than or equal (a<=b) | This operator checks if the left operand value is less than or equal to the value of the right. If either condition is satisfied, the operator returns a TRUE value. |
