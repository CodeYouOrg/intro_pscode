print ("Welcome to the Warehouse Navigation Game!

In this game, you’ll be navigating through a 30 by 30 warehouse. You can move in four directions: north, south, east, and west. Your goal is to reach a randomly generated location.

The warehouse is divided into a grid, and you’ll start at a position of your choice.

You cannot move outside the boundaries of the warehouse. 

Please choose your starting position by entering two numbers for the coordinates:

For example, the coordinates (0, 0) represent the top-left corner of the warehouse.
Where would you like to start?")
