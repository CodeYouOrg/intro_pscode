//* location D is West
//* location E is HERE (no movement needed)
//* location F is East
//* location G is South, then West
//* location H is South
//* location I is South, then East

switch(location) {
    case 'locationA':
    have customer walk North, then walk West:
    break

    case 'locationB':
    have customer walk North:
    break
    
    case 'locationC':

    break

    case 'locationI':
    have customer walk South, then walk East:
    break
    }
    print "You have reached your destination!"
    
    //* if I was doing a real program I would add "where would you like to go next, if finished, please exit?"
    //* if the customer entered a product or destination, the program would search for the location 
    //* Then the switch statement would be used again
    //* I'd have the program continue until the customer chose exit, then have the program reset on the home page
