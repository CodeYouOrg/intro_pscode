Python
for num in range(2, 51, 2):
  print(num)
Explanation:
`range(2, 51, 2)`:
This generates a sequence of numbers starting from 2, up to (but not including) 51, with a step of 2. This will produce the even numbers from 2 to 50.
`for num in ...`:
This loop iterates through each number (`num`) in the sequence generated by `range`.
`print(num)`:
Inside the loop, each number is printed to the console.
Key Points:
Simplicity: This code directly addresses the task of printing numbers from 2 to 50, counting by twos, using a simple `for` loop and the `range` function.
Readability: The code is concise and easy to understand, making it maintainable and adaptable for future modifications.
Efficiency: The `range` function generates the sequence of numbers efficiently, optimizing performance.
