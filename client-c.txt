Task C: Product Package Counter
Task: You need to develop a program that counts the number of items that a hardware device scans to sort for boxing packages into cases. Each package scanned is two (2) products. Each case can only fit 50 product packages. Write a program that prints numbers from 2 to 50, counting by twos.

Hint: Loops

Determine number of packages per box and how many items in each package

    Create a count state Variables intialized at zero

    While count state is <=50 increments count state by 2

let count_state = 0;
print count_state;
while (count_state < 50) {
    count_state + 2;
    print count_state;
    if (count_state === 50) {
        print("Limit of 50 packages has been reached!")
        break
    }
}
