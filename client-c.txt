Task C: Product Package Counter

/* Task: You need to develop a program that counts the number of items that a hardware device scans to sort 
/* for boxing packages into cases. Each package scanned is two (2) products. Each case can only fit 50 product packages.
/* Write a program that prints numbers from 2 to 50, counting by twos.

Start 
itemScancount = 0
productCount = 0
packageCount = 0

/* Create a function with a while loop named caseCount
function caseCount{
while  productCount  > 0 and  <= 50 {
        print 'Package Count = ' + packageCount
        print 'Product Count = ' + productCount
        packageCount = itemScancount
        itemScancount = itemScancount + 1
        productCount = productCount + 2
        }
   }

main {        
     call function caseCount {     
             
     }
     if productCount > 0 {
       print 'Case is full. Start a new case.'
       call function caseCount
       }
       else{ 
         print 'There are no more product packages'
         }
     }
End


/* Note - continute improving the program by adding in a variable and counter for cases to print the total number of cases
